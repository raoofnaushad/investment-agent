{"source": "client_profiler", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 186, "completion_tokens": 982}, "metadata": {}, "content": "### Client Profile Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **Basic Demographics and Financial Overview:**\n   - **Age:** 45 years\n   - **Income:** $200,000 per year\n   - **Investment Horizon:** 20 years (age 65, standard retirement target)\n   - **Objective:** Retirement planning\n\n#### 2. **Risk Tolerance:**\n   - **Moderate Risk:** This is a balanced risk preference. The client is likely comfortable with a mix of growth-oriented and income-generating investments, seeking measured returns with an acceptable level of volatility.\n\n#### 3. **Constraints and Preferences:**\n   - No specific constraints, liabilities, or additional details were provided.\n   - The focus remains on retirement with a 20-year horizon, allowing for a mix of higher growth in the early stages, potentially shifting toward preservation of capital in later years.\n\n#### 4. **Time Horizon Considerations:**\n   - A long investment horizon of 20 years supports a portfolio that emphasizes reasonable growth in the earlier years.\n   - As the client ages and approaches retirement, a gradual shift toward lower-risk and income-generating investments would be suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Investment Approach:\nGiven the moderate risk tolerance, a 20-year horizon, and retirement planning as the primary goal, I recommend a **balanced portfolio** consisting of diverse asset classes to achieve a mix of growth and stability. Below is the proposed allocation:\n\n#### **1. Asset Allocation (Moderate Risk Profile):**\n   - **Equities (50-60%):** Primary growth engine of the portfolio.\n     - **US Large-Cap Stocks:** 30%\n     - **International/Global Stocks (Developed and Emerging Markets):** 15-20%\n     - **Small-Cap/Mid-Cap Stocks:** 5-10%\n   - **Fixed Income (30-40%):** Provides stability and consistent income.\n     - **Government Bonds (US Treasuries):** 15%\n     - **Corporate Bonds (Investment-Grade):** 10-15%\n     - **Municipal Bonds (if tax-advantaged vehicles are preferred):** 5%  \n   - **Alternatives (0-5%):** Potential hedge against inflation and additional diversification.\n     - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)\n     - Commodities or inflation-protected securities (e.g., TIPS)\n   - **Cash and Cash Equivalents (5%):** For liquidity needs and emergency purposes.\n\n#### **2. Potential Strategy Adjustments Over Time (Life-Cycle Allocation):**\n   - At around 10 years into the horizon (age 55), begin reducing equity exposure and increasing fixed-income and/or cash allocation to preserve capital.\n   - By retirement (age 65), transition to a **conservative portfolio** (e.g., 30% equities and 70% fixed income/cash) to prioritize capital preservation and generate income.\n\n#### **3. Investment Products:**\n   - **Equities:**\n     - **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Low-cost, diversified options (e.g., S&P 500 ETFs for large-cap exposure, international equity ETFs for global diversification).\n     - **Mutual Funds:** Managed equity funds to align with moderate risk preferences.  \n   - **Fixed Income:**\n     - Laddered bond portfolios to manage interest rate risk.\n     - Fixed-income ETFs for diversified exposure to government and corporate bonds.\n   - **Alternatives:**\n     - REIT or real asset funds for inflation protection and income generation.\n   - **Cash:** High-yield savings account, money market funds, or equivalent low-risk, liquid instruments.\n\n#### **4. Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**\n   - Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as a **401(k)** or **IRA**, to maximize tax efficiency.\n   - Consider Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible or focusing on traditional retirement accounts for current tax benefits.\n\n#### **5. Monitoring and Rebalancing:**\n   - Rebalance portfolio annually (or semi-annually) to maintain the desired allocation.\n   - Adjust strategy based on changes to personal circumstances, risk tolerance, or market conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis **balanced portfolio** aligns with the client's moderate risk tolerance, 20-year horizon, and retirement planning goal. It provides a blend of equities for long-term growth and fixed income for stability. Over time, rebalancing and transitioning to a more conservative allocation will protect accumulated wealth and provide income in retirement.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Confirm the client's preferences regarding asset classes (e.g., preference for active vs. passive investment, ethical or sustainable investing, etc.).\n- Validate emergency savings or additional retirement vehicles in use.\n- Implement portfolio and schedule periodic reviews to align with the client's evolving financial goals.\n\nPROFILE COMPLETE", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}

The benefit of having a globally diversified portfolio is that you can reduce overall volatility and increase returns. The outperformance of one region can make up for the underperformance of another region.\\n\\nFor more hands-on investors, you may even be able to modestly boost returns further by investing more heavily in undervalued areas. In other words, you can invest more heavily in areas that have underperformed recently, and that are trading at lower valuations.\\n\\nFor example, Meb Faber, the CFO of Cambria Investment management, calculated that if you had invested in the cheapest 25% of countries in terms of CAPE, you would have crushed the S&P 500 between 1993 and 2018 (orange line vs dark blue line):\\n\\n![International Stocks Outperformance](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/global-cape-ratio-25-years.png)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[Meb Faber](https://mebfaber.com/2019/01/06/you-would-have-missed-961-in-gains-using-the-cape-ratio-and-thats-a-good-thing/)_\\n\\nThat chart is logarithmic so the visual difference is smaller than it really is. Investing in the S&P 500 would have returned **962%** from 1993 to 2018. Investing in the cheapest 25% of countries based on CAPE ratios would have returned **3,052%** , or more than three times as much.\\n\\n## Discussion: Market-Cap Weighting\\n\\nMany investors don\u2019t look carefully at the international index funds that they select. They pick a single well-known fund like the Vanguard Total International Stock fund or the MSCI EAFE index and assume it covers their basis.\\n\\nThe problem is, a lot of those common broad international funds are heavily concentrated into just a few countries, and Japan alone makes up **18-25%** of their portfolio. This can have a dramatically negative affect over decades.\\n\\nThis is because most international index funds are weighted by market capitalization.\\n\\nWhat this means is that instead of being equally distributed among the companies in their investing scope, they put more money into the biggest ones. Some people think this is the best approach, while others prefer an [equal weighted index](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/).\\n\\nBut while weighting by market capitalization makes decent sense on a domestic basis, it makes less sense when applied internationally. When international indices weight themselves by market capitalization with no other factors, it results in a huge concentration into just two or three countries. This is because they are not just weighted by the market capitalization of each company, but also by the market capitalization of each _country_.\\n\\nThis means that slow-growing and mature countries like Japan and Europe dominate just about every international index.\\n\\nJapan, as good as the country is, is not particularly investor-friendly, with low growth and low dividends. And now the country faces population shrinkage.\\n\\nDespite all this, I\u2019m not necessarily even forecasting that Japan won\u2019t do well. That\u2019s not the core point.\\n\\nI don\u2019t mind having Japan in my portfolio, but would I want Japan as a full 18-25% of my international holdings? Of course not.\\n\\nIs there any particular reason why investors\u2019 money should be 3x more concentrated in Japan than Canada? Or 6x more concentrated in Japan than South Korea? Or 11x more concentrated in Japan than Brazil? Just because Japan\u2019s stock market is the biggest\\n\\nThere\u2019s no compelling reason for international stock funds to be weighted strictly by the stock market size each country. It makes far more sense to broaden and diversify more evenly, so that you\u2019re not so heavily tied to the fate of just one country. Especially a shrinking country.\\n\\nFor international stock funds, there\u2019s no compelling reason that market capitalization weighting is the best way to go. I certainly don\u2019t want most of _my_ international stocks concentrated into Japan and Europe; I\u2019d rather have broader exposure.\\n\\n## Broader Diversification\\n\\n  * If you invest all your foreign holdings into something like the Vanguard International Stock Index (VEU), you\u2019ll be 18% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n  * If you invest in the Vanguard Developed Stock Index (VEA), you\u2019ll be 22% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n  * If you stick to the popular MSCI EAFE index and all the funds that track it, it\u2019ll be more like 25% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, you\u2019ll be heavily invested in continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, etc) which shares interconnected geopolitical risks.\\n\\nThere are a couple easy and passive ways to spread out your exposure, though.\\n\\n### Idea #1) Add a Dividend Metric\\n\\nWhen you add another metric to the equation besides pure market capitalization, it change which countries dominate the index. Adding a dividend metric often reduces or eliminates Japan from the running.\\n\\nFor example, if you put 50% of your international holdings into the Vanguard International Stock Index ETF (VXUS), and 50% into the Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation Stock Index ETF (VIGI), your exposure will look more like this:\\n\\n![International Stocks: ETF Split Example](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/international-stocks-etf-split.png)\\n\\nThat approach helps to move some assets out of Japan and spread them around a bit, especially into Canada and India.\\n\\n### Idea #2) Split Developed and Emerging Markets\\n\\nDeveloped countries tend to have the biggest stock markets, and thus larger market capitalization. They totally dominate the allocation percentages of market cap-weighted index funds and ETFs.\\n\\nBut, most global growth is coming from [emerging markets](https://www.lynalden.com/invest-in-emerging-markets/).\\n\\nOver the next couple decades, several emerging markets will be the biggest economies in the world:\\n\\n![Emerging Markets Growth Projections](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/emerging-markets-growth-projections-2040.jpg)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[PwC Global](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/the-world-in-2050.html)_\\n\\nAlready, most global growth is coming from emerging markets:\\n\\n![Emerging Markets Growth Chart](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/emerging-markets-growth.jpg)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[IMF World Economic Outlook](http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2017/04/04/world-economic-outlook-april-2017)_\\n\\nDespite this, due to weighting by market capitalization, the Vanguard FTSE All-World Index ETF (VEU), which represents the world besides the United States, and indices just like it, have only about a quarter of their assets in emerging markets and three-quarters of their assets in developed international markets.\\n\\nIn fact, the Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF (VT), which includes the United States and all major countries and represents literally the entire world by market capitalization, has less than 12% of its assets in emerging markets.\\n\\nFor this reason, I like to split my emerging markets exposure and developed foreign exposure into separate allocations, and then weight the emerging exposure more heavily. Emerging markets are more volatile, but that\u2019s where most forward GDP growth is coming from.\\n\\nFor example, in a M1 Finance portfolio, you can overweight emerging markets:\\n\\n[![International Stocks: M1 ETF Portfolio](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/international-stocks-etf-portfolio.png)](https://m1finance.8bxp97.net/AN5mN)\\n\\nEach month, I add money to my M1 Finance account, so if emerging markets dip, my allocation buys the dip and brings the allocation back to where I want it. If developed markets dip, my allocation buys that dip instead.\\n\\nIf I was investing in a pure market-cap weighted index like VEU, then when emerging markets go down, I would have less exposure to them than before. However, as a value investor, I want to **increase** my weighting towards assets that recently underformed, because that\u2019s what tends to offer better returns **going forward**.\\n\\nThat\u2019s value investing at its finest, and is why I invest with M1 Finance as one of my accounts.\\n\\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, right now, emerging markets are cheaper than stocks in the United States or the developed world.\\n\\n## International Stock ETFs for 2024\\n\\nChoosing the right international stock ETF is a combination of the following:\\n\\n  * Which countries you want exposure to, and in what proportions\\n  * What market-caps you want to include (large, medium, small)\\n  * Any additional metrics you want (growth, dividends, etc)\\n  * Expense ratio: [the lower th\\n...(truncated)'}, {'title': 'The Best International-Stock Funds | Morningstar', 'link': 'https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-international-stock-funds', 'snippet': 'Oct 22, 2024 ... ...

Some investors want foreign stocks in their portfolios to round out their exposure to the global stock market and widen their investment opportunity set. [Dan Lefkovitz](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/601/dan-lefkovitz), a strategist with Morningstar Indexes, estimates that US stocks now represent more than 63% of the market capitalization of the [Morningstar Global Markets Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-markets-FSUSA0AOJI?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview), with foreign stocks representing the remaining 37%.

Why? These 22 funds are what many would call \u201ccore\u201d international stock funds. Funds that land in one of the foreign large-cap categories tend to focus on companies in Europe, specifically in the established markets in France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, and the UK. They often hold significant positions in Asia as well. And although they dabble in emerging-markets stocks, they often cap their exposure to those markets to about 15% of assets.\\n\\nThe best large-cap international-stock mutual funds and ETFs list includes a good deal of variety. Solid index funds stand side by side with successful active strategies. Some managers on the list favor value stocks, while others prefer growth stocks\u2014and some funds blend the two.

been the engine of global economic growth, offering vast [opportunities](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/products/opportunities/the-new-emerging-markets-epoch) and presenting unique challenges. With increased geopolitical uncertainty in recent years, the outlook for these markets is the subject of intense scrutiny. These dynamic countries, characterized by rapid growth, evolving demographics, and increasing urbanization, will play a crucial role in shaping the world economy.   \\n  \\nInvestors will look back at the last decade or so and wonder whether they should consider renewed or increased exposure to [emerging markets](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/about-us/key-strengths/emerging-markets) (EM). It\u2019s easy to understand why expectations of EM are anchored to the past. From 2001 to 2010, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperformed the MSCI World Index by a wide margin. Yet since 2011, EM equities have significantly lagged developed markets, and many investors are now underweight the asset class.   \\n  \\nHowever, even a cursory glance at the history of EM performance will quickly show that looking back to assess the future is not a particularly useful approach to take. Instead, we think investors should focus on the changing undercurrents in EM economies and markets that we expect will reignite returns in the decade ahead. As economic and political power continues to shift from West to East, several trends and challenges are likely to positively impact these markets significantly. Here we delve into the key factors shaping the trajectory of emerging markets in the next decade, and analyze the opportunities and challenges they face.  \\n\\n\\nshow more \\n\\n##  A story of two decades \\n\\nThe first decade of the 21st century was an outstanding one for EM stocks fueled by unique circumstances. [China](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/products/strategies/chinese-equity) joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, increasing its share of world exports and accelerating globalization. The country made huge investments in fixed assets and real estate, plus it executed a massive credit expansion unleashing a commodities super-cycle. Between 2000 and 2010, China\u2019s GDP grew by an average of over 10.5% per year, boosting global economic activity while enriching commodity-producing EM countries and supporting their currencies. In the same period, developed markets struggled to perform, recovering from the tech \u2018dot.com\u2019 bubble bursting (2001) only to endure the sub-prime disaster in 2007. The US dollar also weakened significantly during this time further helping EM performance.   \\n  \\nComing out of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009, the overwhelming consensus was that US dominance after two 50% stock market crashes in one decade was over. EM countries were going to be the future. This consensus view could not have been more wrong in the decade that followed.  \\n  \\nBetween 2011 and now, the MSCI World Index significantly outperformed the MSCI EM Index. Central banks in developed markets used quantitative easing (QE) and artificially low interest rates to counter the fall-out from the GFC. This incentivized US corporate borrowing, increased leverage and stock buybacks resulting in PE multiple expansion and developed market outperformance. From 2014 onward, the US dollar also strengthened, eroding the relative competitiveness of EM exports. Commodity prices eased and geopolitical concerns intensified, from the US-China trade wars to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while the Covid pandemic added new challenges. China slowed down and undertook regulatory reform which undercut the fast-growing technology c\\n...(truncated)'}]", "name": "google_search", "call_id": "call_agoQJ4MLQPbuMz2DunzVRD39", "is_error": false}], "type": "ToolCallExecutionEvent", "message_type": "ToolCallExecutionEvent"}

Tax efficiency, diversification, and periodic rebalancing ensure optimal growth with manageable risk. Transitioning to a more conservative stance at age 55 will safeguard retirement wealth.\n\n**PORTFOLIO READY**", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}

The client is likely comfortable with a mix of growth-oriented and income-generating investments, seeking measured returns with an acceptable level of volatility.\n\n#### 3. **Constraints and Preferences:**\n   - No specific constraints, liabilities, or additional details were provided.\n   - The focus remains on retirement with a 20-year horizon, allowing for a mix of higher growth in the early stages, potentially shifting toward preservation of capital in later years.\n\n#### 4. **Time Horizon Considerations:**\n   - A long investment horizon of 20 years supports a portfolio that emphasizes reasonable growth in the earlier years.\n   - As the client ages and approaches retirement, a gradual shift toward lower-risk and income-generating investments would be suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Investment Approach:\nGiven the moderate risk tolerance, a 20-year horizon, and retirement planning as the primary goal, I recommend a **balanced portfolio** consisting of diverse asset classes to achieve a mix of growth and stability. Below is the proposed allocation:\n\n#### **1. Asset Allocation (Moderate Risk Profile):**\n   - **Equities (50-60%):** Primary growth engine of the portfolio.\n     - **US Large-Cap Stocks:** 30%\n     - **International/Global Stocks (Developed and Emerging Markets):** 15-20%\n     - **Small-Cap/Mid-Cap Stocks:** 5-10%\n   - **Fixed Income (30-40%):** Provides stability and consistent income.\n     - **Government Bonds (US Treasuries):** 15%\n     - **Corporate Bonds (Investment-Grade):** 10-15%\n     - **Municipal Bonds (if tax-advantaged vehicles are preferred):** 5%  \n   - **Alternatives (0-5%):** Potential hedge against inflation and additional diversification.\n     - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)\n     - Commodities or inflation-protected securities (e.g., TIPS)\n   - **Cash and Cash Equivalents (5%):** For liquidity needs and emergency purposes.\n\n#### **2. Potential Strategy Adjustments Over Time (Life-Cycle Allocation):**\n   - At around 10 years into the horizon (age 55), begin reducing equity exposure and increasing fixed-income and/or cash allocation to preserve capital.\n   - By retirement (age 65), transition to a **conservative portfolio** (e.g., 30% equities and 70% fixed income/cash) to prioritize capital preservation and generate income.\n\n#### **3. Investment Products:**\n   - **Equities:**\n     - **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):** Low-cost, diversified options (e.g., S&P 500 ETFs for large-cap exposure, international equity ETFs for global diversification).\n     - **Mutual Funds:** Managed equity funds to align with moderate risk preferences.  \n   - **Fixed Income:**\n     - Laddered bond portfolios to manage interest rate risk.\n     - Fixed-income ETFs for diversified exposure to government and corporate bonds.\n   - **Alternatives:**\n     - REIT or real asset funds for inflation protection and income generation.\n   - **Cash:** High-yield savings account, money market funds, or equivalent low-risk, liquid instruments.\n\n#### **4. Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**\n   - Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as a **401(k)** or **IRA**, to maximize tax efficiency.\n   - Consider Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible or focusing on traditional retirement accounts for current tax benefits.\n\n#### **5. Monitoring and Rebalancing:**\n   - Rebalance portfolio annually (or semi-annually) to maintain the desired allocation.\n   - Adjust strategy based on changes to personal circumstances, risk tolerance, or market conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis **balanced portfolio** aligns with the client's moderate risk tolerance, 20-year horizon, and retirement planning goal. It provides a blend of equities for long-term growth and fixed income for stability. Over time, rebalancing and transitioning to a more conservative allocation will protect accumulated wealth and provide income in retirement.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Confirm the client's preferences regarding asset classes (e.g., preference for active vs. passive investment, ethical or sustainable investing, etc.).\n- Validate emergency savings or additional retirement vehicles in use.\n- Implement portfolio and schedule periodic reviews to align with the client's evolving financial goals.\n\nPROFILE COMPLETE", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}, {"source": "research_strategist", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1258, "completion_tokens": 518}, "metadata": {}, "content": "### Research Queries for the Client's Investment Portfolio:\n\n#### 1. **Equity Investments:**\n   - Query: \"Top moderate-risk ETFs for US large-cap stocks 2024 performance, 5-year returns, expense ratios\"\n   - Query: \"Best performing international ETFs focusing on developed and emerging markets 2024 trends\"\n   - Data Points: Performance (YTD, 1-year, 5-year), expense ratios, dividend yields\n\n#### 2. **Fixed Income Investments:**\n   - Query: \"High-rated government bond ETFs suitability for moderate investors 2024\"\n   - Query: \"Investment-grade corporate bond funds yielding steady returns 2024 review\"\n   - Query: \"Municipal bond funds tax advantages income potential 2024\"\n   - Data Points: Credit ratings, average yields, expense ratios, tax benefits\n\n#### 3. **Alternative Investments:**\n   - Query: \"Top-performing diversified REITs income-focused 2024 growth potential\"\n   - Query: \"TIPS and other inflation-hedging securities 2024 outlook\"\n   - Data Points: Yields, inflation-protection mechanisms, historical performance\n\n#### 4. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**\n   - Query: \"Comparison between Roth IRA and Traditional IRA advantages for 20-year horizon 2024 updates\"\n   - Query: \"401(k) contribution and employer match trends professionals earning $200,000\"\n   - Data Points: Tax benefits, contribution limits, pre-tax/post-tax growth potential  \n\n#### 5. **Lifecycle Investment Strategies:**\n   - Query: \"Glide paths for retirement funds transitioning from 60% equity to 30% equity\"\n   - Query: \"Target-date retirement funds best suited for 2045 retirement goals moderate risk\"\n   - Data Points: Allocation shifts over time, historical performance, management fees\n\n#### 6. **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**\n   - Query: \"Best practices for portfolio rebalancing moderate-risk investors 20-year plan\"\n   - Data Points: Ideal rebalancing frequency, historical ROI differences with/without rebalancing\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Research Areas:\n- **Equities and Fixed Income** are prioritized for their central role in a balanced, moderate-risk approach.\n- **Alternatives** like REITs or TIPS are secondary for diversification and inflation protection.\n- **Tax-efficient strategies** are critical for maximizing retirement savings potential over 20 years.\n- Monitoring and lifecycle strategies ensure alignment with the client's changing risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\nRESEARCH PLAN READY", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}, {"source": "research_agent", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2011, "completion_tokens": 110}, "metadata": {}, "content": [{"id": "call_eYtaey7GeQDV2fnBkbnDVEQA", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"Top moderate-risk ETFs for US large-cap stocks 2024 performance, 5-year returns, expense ratios\", \"num_results\": 3, \"include_snippets\": true, \"include_content\": true}", "name": "google_search"}, {"id": "call_agoQJ4MLQPbuMz2DunzVRD39", "arguments": "{\"query\": \"Best performing international ETFs focusing on developed and emerging markets 2024 trends\", \"num_results\": 3, \"include_snippets\": true, \"include_content\": true}", "name": "google_search"}], "type": "ToolCallRequestEvent", "message_type": "ToolCallRequestEvent"}, {"source": "research_agent", "models_usage": null, "metadata": {}, "content": [{"content": "[{'title': 'Calvert US Large-Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (I) (CISIX ...', 'link': 'https://www.calvert.com/calvert-us-large-cap-core-responsible-index-fund-cisix.php', 'snippet': 'Expense Ratio (Gross)3, 0.34%.

The benefit of having a globally diversified portfolio is that you can reduce overall volatility and increase returns. The outperformance of one region can make up for the underperformance of another region.\\n\\nFor more hands-on investors, you may even be able to modestly boost returns further by investing more heavily in undervalued areas. In other words, you can invest more heavily in areas that have underperformed recently, and that are trading at lower valuations.\\n\\nFor example, Meb Faber, the CFO of Cambria Investment management, calculated that if you had invested in the cheapest 25% of countries in terms of CAPE, you would have crushed the S&P 500 between 1993 and 2018 (orange line vs dark blue line):\\n\\n![International Stocks Outperformance](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/global-cape-ratio-25-years.png)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[Meb Faber](https://mebfaber.com/2019/01/06/you-would-have-missed-961-in-gains-using-the-cape-ratio-and-thats-a-good-thing/)_\\n\\nThat chart is logarithmic so the visual difference is smaller than it really is. Investing in the S&P 500 would have returned **962%** from 1993 to 2018. Investing in the cheapest 25% of countries based on CAPE ratios would have returned **3,052%** , or more than three times as much.\\n\\n## Discussion: Market-Cap Weighting\\n\\nMany investors don\u2019t look carefully at the international index funds that they select. They pick a single well-known fund like the Vanguard Total International Stock fund or the MSCI EAFE index and assume it covers their basis.\\n\\nThe problem is, a lot of those common broad international funds are heavily concentrated into just a few countries, and Japan alone makes up **18-25%** of their portfolio. This can have a dramatically negative affect over decades.\\n\\nThis is because most international index funds are weighted by market capitalization.\\n\\nWhat this means is that instead of being equally distributed among the companies in their investing scope, they put more money into the biggest ones. Some people think this is the best approach, while others prefer an [equal weighted index](https://www.lynalden.com/equal-weighted-index-funds/).\\n\\nBut while weighting by market capitalization makes decent sense on a domestic basis, it makes less sense when applied internationally. When international indices weight themselves by market capitalization with no other factors, it results in a huge concentration into just two or three countries. This is because they are not just weighted by the market capitalization of each company, but also by the market capitalization of each _country_.\\n\\nThis means that slow-growing and mature countries like Japan and Europe dominate just about every international index.\\n\\nJapan, as good as the country is, is not particularly investor-friendly, with low growth and low dividends. And now the country faces population shrinkage.\\n\\nDespite all this, I\u2019m not necessarily even forecasting that Japan won\u2019t do well. That\u2019s not the core point.\\n\\nI don\u2019t mind having Japan in my portfolio, but would I want Japan as a full 18-25% of my international holdings? Of course not.\\n\\nIs there any particular reason why investors\u2019 money should be 3x more concentrated in Japan than Canada? Or 6x more concentrated in Japan than South Korea? Or 11x more concentrated in Japan than Brazil? Just because Japan\u2019s stock market is the biggest\\n\\nThere\u2019s no compelling reason for international stock funds to be weighted strictly by the stock market size each country. It makes far more sense to broaden and diversify more evenly, so that you\u2019re not so heavily tied to the fate of just one country. Especially a shrinking country.\\n\\nFor international stock funds, there\u2019s no compelling reason that market capitalization weighting is the best way to go. I certainly don\u2019t want most of _my_ international stocks concentrated into Japan and Europe; I\u2019d rather have broader exposure.\\n\\n## Broader Diversification\\n\\n  * If you invest all your foreign holdings into something like the Vanguard International Stock Index (VEU), you\u2019ll be 18% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n  * If you invest in the Vanguard Developed Stock Index (VEA), you\u2019ll be 22% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n  * If you stick to the popular MSCI EAFE index and all the funds that track it, it\u2019ll be more like 25% in Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, you\u2019ll be heavily invested in continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, etc) which shares interconnected geopolitical risks.\\n\\nThere are a couple easy and passive ways to spread out your exposure, though.\\n\\n### Idea #1) Add a Dividend Metric\\n\\nWhen you add another metric to the equation besides pure market capitalization, it change which countries dominate the index. Adding a dividend metric often reduces or eliminates Japan from the running.\\n\\nFor example, if you put 50% of your international holdings into the Vanguard International Stock Index ETF (VXUS), and 50% into the Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation Stock Index ETF (VIGI), your exposure will look more like this:\\n\\n![International Stocks: ETF Split Example](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/international-stocks-etf-split.png)\\n\\nThat approach helps to move some assets out of Japan and spread them around a bit, especially into Canada and India.\\n\\n### Idea #2) Split Developed and Emerging Markets\\n\\nDeveloped countries tend to have the biggest stock markets, and thus larger market capitalization. They totally dominate the allocation percentages of market cap-weighted index funds and ETFs.\\n\\nBut, most global growth is coming from [emerging markets](https://www.lynalden.com/invest-in-emerging-markets/).\\n\\nOver the next couple decades, several emerging markets will be the biggest economies in the world:\\n\\n![Emerging Markets Growth Projections](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/emerging-markets-growth-projections-2040.jpg)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[PwC Global](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/the-world-in-2050.html)_\\n\\nAlready, most global growth is coming from emerging markets:\\n\\n![Emerging Markets Growth Chart](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/emerging-markets-growth.jpg)\\n\\n_Chart Source:[IMF World Economic Outlook](http://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2017/04/04/world-economic-outlook-april-2017)_\\n\\nDespite this, due to weighting by market capitalization, the Vanguard FTSE All-World Index ETF (VEU), which represents the world besides the United States, and indices just like it, have only about a quarter of their assets in emerging markets and three-quarters of their assets in developed international markets.\\n\\nIn fact, the Vanguard Total World Stock Index ETF (VT), which includes the United States and all major countries and represents literally the entire world by market capitalization, has less than 12% of its assets in emerging markets.\\n\\nFor this reason, I like to split my emerging markets exposure and developed foreign exposure into separate allocations, and then weight the emerging exposure more heavily. Emerging markets are more volatile, but that\u2019s where most forward GDP growth is coming from.\\n\\nFor example, in a M1 Finance portfolio, you can overweight emerging markets:\\n\\n[![International Stocks: M1 ETF Portfolio](https://www.lynalden.com/wp-content/uploads/international-stocks-etf-portfolio.png)](https://m1finance.8bxp97.net/AN5mN)\\n\\nEach month, I add money to my M1 Finance account, so if emerging markets dip, my allocation buys the dip and brings the allocation back to where I want it. If developed markets dip, my allocation buys that dip instead.\\n\\nIf I was investing in a pure market-cap weighted index like VEU, then when emerging markets go down, I would have less exposure to them than before. However, as a value investor, I want to **increase** my weighting towards assets that recently underformed, because that\u2019s what tends to offer better returns **going forward**.\\n\\nThat\u2019s value investing at its finest, and is why I invest with M1 Finance as one of my accounts.\\n\\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, right now, emerging markets are cheaper than stocks in the United States or the developed world.\\n\\n## International Stock ETFs for 2024\\n\\nChoosing the right international stock ETF is a combination of the following:\\n\\n  * Which countries you want exposure to, and in what proportions\\n  * What market-caps you want to include (large, medium, small)\\n  * Any additional metrics you want (growth, dividends, etc)\\n  * Expense ratio: [the lower th\\n...(truncated)'}, {'title': 'The Best International-Stock Funds | Morningstar', 'link': 'https://www.morningstar.com/funds/best-international-stock-funds', 'snippet': 'Oct 22, 2024 ... ...

Some investors want foreign stocks in their portfolios to round out their exposure to the global stock market and widen their investment opportunity set. [Dan Lefkovitz](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/601/dan-lefkovitz), a strategist with Morningstar Indexes, estimates that US stocks now represent more than 63% of the market capitalization of the [Morningstar Global Markets Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-markets-FSUSA0AOJI?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview), with foreign stocks representing the remaining 37%.

Why? These 22 funds are what many would call \u201ccore\u201d international stock funds. Funds that land in one of the foreign large-cap categories tend to focus on companies in Europe, specifically in the established markets in France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, and the UK. They often hold significant positions in Asia as well. And although they dabble in emerging-markets stocks, they often cap their exposure to those markets to about 15% of assets.\\n\\nThe best large-cap international-stock mutual funds and ETFs list includes a good deal of variety. Solid index funds stand side by side with successful active strategies. Some managers on the list favor value stocks, while others prefer growth stocks\u2014and some funds blend the two. Some lean more heavily than others into emerging-markets stocks, as well.\\n\\nTo choose the best international-stock fund for your portfolio from this list, be sure to consult the individual analyst reports for each fund.\\n\\n## More of the Best ETFs to Buy\\n\\n### [The Best Active ETFs to Buy These actively managed exchange-traded funds earn high ratings from Morningstar in 2025. ![Illustration of medalist fund ratings](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/4QW6LMTIMVFVRIUHN7HDISE2HU.png)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/best-active-etfs-buy)### [The Best Bond ETFs The fixed-income exchange-traded funds on this list earn Morningstar\u2019s top rating in 2025. ![Bonds Hero](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/AQETT7LOP5E2ZJBEHHEQLEHDQI.jpg)](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/best-bond-etfs)### [The Best Equity ETFs These exchan\\n...(truncated)'}, {'title': 'Three emerging markets trends for the next decade | Robeco Global', 'link': 'https://www.robeco.com/en-int/insights/2024/05/three-emerging-markets-trends-for-the-next-decade', 'snippet': 'May 12, 2024 ...

been the engine of global economic growth, offering vast [opportunities](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/products/opportunities/the-new-emerging-markets-epoch) and presenting unique challenges. With increased geopolitical uncertainty in recent years, the outlook for these markets is the subject of intense scrutiny. These dynamic countries, characterized by rapid growth, evolving demographics, and increasing urbanization, will play a crucial role in shaping the world economy.   \\n  \\nInvestors will look back at the last decade or so and wonder whether they should consider renewed or increased exposure to [emerging markets](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/about-us/key-strengths/emerging-markets) (EM). It\u2019s easy to understand why expectations of EM are anchored to the past. From 2001 to 2010, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperformed the MSCI World Index by a wide margin. Yet since 2011, EM equities have significantly lagged developed markets, and many investors are now underweight the asset class.   \\n  \\nHowever, even a cursory glance at the history of EM performance will quickly show that looking back to assess the future is not a particularly useful approach to take. Instead, we think investors should focus on the changing undercurrents in EM economies and markets that we expect will reignite returns in the decade ahead. As economic and political power continues to shift from West to East, several trends and challenges are likely to positively impact these markets significantly. Here we delve into the key factors shaping the trajectory of emerging markets in the next decade, and analyze the opportunities and challenges they face.  \\n\\n\\nshow more \\n\\n##  A story of two decades \\n\\nThe first decade of the 21st century was an outstanding one for EM stocks fueled by unique circumstances. [China](https://www.robeco.com/en-int/products/strategies/chinese-equity) joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, increasing its share of world exports and accelerating globalization. The country made huge investments in fixed assets and real estate, plus it executed a massive credit expansion unleashing a commodities super-cycle. Between 2000 and 2010, China\u2019s GDP grew by an average of over 10.5% per year, boosting global economic activity while enriching commodity-producing EM countries and supporting their currencies. In the same period, developed markets struggled to perform, recovering from the tech \u2018dot.com\u2019 bubble bursting (2001) only to endure the sub-prime disaster in 2007. The US dollar also weakened significantly during this time further helping EM performance.   \\n  \\nComing out of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-2009, the overwhelming consensus was that US dominance after two 50% stock market crashes in one decade was over. EM countries were going to be the future. This consensus view could not have been more wrong in the decade that followed.  \\n  \\nBetween 2011 and now, the MSCI World Index significantly outperformed the MSCI EM Index. Central banks in developed markets used quantitative easing (QE) and artificially low interest rates to counter the fall-out from the GFC. This incentivized US corporate borrowing, increased leverage and stock buybacks resulting in PE multiple expansion and developed market outperformance. From 2014 onward, the US dollar also strengthened, eroding the relative competitiveness of EM exports. Commodity prices eased and geopolitical concerns intensified, from the US-China trade wars to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, while the Covid pandemic added new challenges. China slowed down and undertook regulatory reform which undercut the fast-growing technology c\\n...(truncated)'}]", "name": "google_search", "call_id": "call_agoQJ4MLQPbuMz2DunzVRD39", "is_error": false}], "type": "ToolCallExecutionEvent", "message_type": "ToolCallExecutionEvent"}, {"source": "research_agent", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 17092, "completion_tokens": 536}, "metadata": {}, "content": "### Research Findings: Equity Investments for Moderate-Risk Portfolios\n\n#### **US Large-Cap ETFs**\n1. **Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX):**\n   - **5-Year Returns:** ~11.92% annually (as of late 2024).\n   - **Expense Ratio:** 0.015%, extremely low-cost.\n   - **Dividend Yield:** Approx. 1.27%.\n   - **Highlights:** Offers broad exposure to the S&P 500 with a proven track record, making it ideal for moderate-risk investors seeking stable growth.\n\n2. **Calvert US Large-Cap Core Responsible Index (CISIX):**\n   - **5-Year Returns:** N/A.\n   - **Expense Ratio:** 0.24% (Net).\n   - **Top Holdings:** Includes Apple, NVIDIA, and other technology majors.\n   - **Sustainability Focus:** CSR-focused.\n\n3. **PGIM Jennison Growth Fund (Class Z):**\n   - **Category Performance Ranking:** Top percentile for 1-, 3-, and 5-year returns among large-cap growth funds.\n   - **Cost:** Specialized yet moderate fees.\n\n---\n\n#### **International ETFs (Developed & Emerging Markets Focus)**\n\n1. **Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU):**\n   - **Coverage:** Ex-US developed and emerging markets.\n   - **5-Year Returns:** 7.11% annualized (as of late 2024).\n   - **Expense Ratio:** 0.08%.\n   - **Region Allocation:** Heavy allocation to Japan (18%) and Europe; emerging market allocation ~25%.\n\n2. **Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation (VIGI):**\n   - **Performance:** Focuses on developed and dividend-paying international markets.\n   - **Expense Ratio:** 0.18%.\n   - **Highlights:** Balanced approach between high-growth developed and dividends.\n\n3. **iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS):**\n   - **Returns:** Comparable to similar broad-market international ETFs.\n   - **Expense Ratio:** ~0.09%.\n   - **Region Focus:** Strong exposure to Europe & Asia; includes a mix of growth/emerging sectors.\n\n#### Observations:\n   - International ETFs are an important diversification component, considering geopolitical and regional market cycles.\n   - Blending emerging markets (higher volatility/growth) with developed market ETFs balances risk.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\nWould you like follow-ups on fixed income, REIT, or lifecycle strategy funds?

Tax efficiency, diversification, and periodic rebalancing ensure optimal growth with manageable risk. Transitioning to a more conservative stance at age 55 will safeguard retirement wealth.\n\n**PORTFOLIO READY**", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}, {"source": "verifier", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3319, "completion_tokens": 3}, "metadata": {}, "content": "VERIFIED", "type": "TextMessage", "message_type": "TextMessage"}, {"source": "summary_agent", "models_usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3335, "completion_tokens": 1284}, "metadata": {}, "content": "### Investment Proposal\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Executive Summary**\nThis investment proposal outlines a comprehensive strategy for a 45-year-old professional with a moderate risk tolerance and a 20-year investment horizon, targeting retirement planning.
